# Pantry Pal: Recipe Finder via Web Scraping

## Overview

The "Pantry Pal" project aims to minimize food waste and simplify meal preparation by providing users with recipes based on their available pantry ingredients. This application utilizes Python and web scraping techniques, along with the Spoonacular API, to fetch recipes from both local databases and online sources. Users can input and store their pantry ingredients, and the application suggests relevant recipes.

## Skills Used

- Python
- Web Scraping
- Problem-Solving
- Unit Testing

## Project Process

1.  **Problem Identification:**
    -   Identified the need for a tool that helps users utilize existing pantry ingredients to reduce food waste.
    -   Focused on bridging the gap in sustainable meal planning for home cooks and professionals.

2.  **Data Management:**
    -   Designed an efficient system for storing and retrieving ingredient data using local files.
    -   Ensured data integrity and fast access to ingredient lists.

3.  **Algorithm Development:**
    -   Implemented web scraping to dynamically fetch recipes from online sources, supplementing the Spoonacular API and local database results.
    -   Developed algorithms to match user-provided ingredients with recipe requirements.

4.  **User-Centric Approach:**
    -   Developed a simple and interactive command-line interface (CLI) to ensure accessibility for all users.
    -   Focused on providing a user-friendly experience for inputting ingredients and retrieving recipes.

## Reflection

This project significantly improved my abilities in:

-   Web scraping and data extraction from online sources.
